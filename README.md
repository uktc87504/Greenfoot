Real Programming - Learn and teach Java, one of the most popular languages in the world!<br\>

Greenfoot teaches object orientation with Java. Create 'actors' which live in 'worlds' to build games, simulations, and other graphical programs.<br\>

Greenfoot is visual and interactive. Visualisation and interaction tools are built into the environment.<br\>
The actors are programmed in standard textual Java code, providing a combination of programming experience in a traditional text-based language with visual execution.<br\>
