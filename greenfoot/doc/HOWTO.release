Prerequisites:
 build.properties in both the greenfoot and bluej source directories should be 
 modified to match your configuration.


Building Greenfoot:
 1. Update version number in build.xml and run "ant update-version-number".
 2. Test bundled scenarios and make sure they are upgraded to new API version.
 3. Run "ant ready-to-run" in the BlueJ directory.
 4. Run "ant dist" in the Greenfoot directory
 5. Build the windows installer (see below).
 6. Copy the builds and source to greenfoot.org.

If necessary:
 7. If the API version has changed, copy Greenfoot-core-X.X.X-jar to the gallery: /home/mygame/mygame/public/sharedjars/
 8. If any of the 3rd party libraries have changed copy them to: /home/mygame/mygame/public/sharedjars/
 9. If the licenses have changed, update GREENFOOT_LICENSES and copy LICENSE.txt and/or THIRDPARTYLICENSE.txt to: www.greenfoot.org/about
 
Finally:
10. Commit any changed files (with updated version numbers etc) to the repository.
 

Building the Windows installer:
 1. Copy the "greenfoot-dist-XXX.jar" to the bluej/package directory
    as "greenfoot-dist.jar"
 2. Build the executable launcher (see bluej/package/winlaunch/BUILD.TXT).
 3. Copy the launcher as "gflaunch.exe" to bluej/package/winlaunch
 4. Update the Greenfoot version number in bluej/package/winlaunch/Greenfoot-README.TXT
 5. Update AppVerName and OutputBaseFilename in bluej/package/winsetup/greenfoot.iss
 6. Run the bluej/package/greenfoot-build.xml ant script's "windows-dist" target

For the MSI Windows package:
 1. Copy the "greenfoot-dist-XXX.jar" to the bluej/package directory
    as "greenfoot-dist.jar"
 2. Build the executable launcher (see bluej/package/winlaunch/BUILD.TXT).
 3. Copy the launcher as "gflaunch.exe" to bluej/package/winlaunch
 4. Update the Greenfoot version number in bluej/package/winlaunch/Greenfoot-README.TXT
 5. Update the Greenfoot version number in bluej/package/winsetup/greenfoot.wxs (in 2 places)
 6. Run the bluej/package/greenfoot-build.xml ant script's "windows-dist" target
